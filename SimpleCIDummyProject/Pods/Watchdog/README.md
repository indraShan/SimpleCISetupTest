```

## Installation

### [Carthage]

[Carthage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

[carthage-installation]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application

### [CocoaPods]

[CocoaPods]: http://cocoapods.org

Add the following to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```ruby
pod 'Watchdog'
```

You will also need to make sure you're opting into using frameworks:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
```

Then run `pod install` with CocoaPods 0.36 or newer.

### Manually

Manually add the file into your Xcode project. Slightly simpler, but updates are also manual.

## Usage

Simply, just instantiate Watchdog with number of seconds that must pass to consider the main thread blocked.

```Swift
let watchdog = Watchdog(threshold: 0.2)
```

You can also write a closure to be called whenever the main thread is blocked.

```Swift
let watchdog = Watchdog(threshold: 0.2) { duration in
	print("Main thread was blocked for \(duration) seconds")
}
```
Don't forget to retain Watchdog somewhere or it will get released when it goes out of scope.
